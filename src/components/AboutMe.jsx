      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science student at PBSC with a strong passion for
        computers and problem-solving. I enjoy turning ideas into functional
        code and projects, with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and
        testing frameworks. Currently pursuing a full-stack development course,
        my long-term goal is to contribute to impactful software while expanding
        my skills in cybersecurity and hardware development.
