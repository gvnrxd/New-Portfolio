        <p>
          Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at PBSC with a strong passion for
          computers and problem-solving. I enjoy turning ideas into functional
          code and projects, with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
          and testing frameworks. Currently pursuing a full-stack development
          course, my long-term goal is to contribute to impactful software while
          expanding my skills in cybersecurity and hardware development.
